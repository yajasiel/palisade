## Internationalization

The web3 front-end is set-up for internationalization allowing us to translate the app into any number of languages.

## Development

The primary change for developers is that you will need to add any strings which may be presented to a user as keys in `src/strings/strings.en.json`. Then, you can reference that given string in your code as such:

```elm
-- In imports
import Strings.Translations as Translations

-- In your code
Translations.string_key userLanguage
```

`userLanguage` is a variable exposed from the top-level model and should be threaded through to your view function.

## Example

For example, consider the following code:

```elm
myViewFunc : Html Msg
myViewFunc =
    [ div [ class "col-xs-5" ] [ label [] [ text "Asset" ] ]
```

This should become:

**src/strings/string.en.json**
```json
{
	// ...
	"asset": "Asset"
}
```

Then:

```elm
myViewFunc : Translations.Lang -> Html Msg
myViewFunc userLanguage =
    [ div [ class "col-xs-5" ] [ label [] [ text (Translations.asset userLanguage) ] ]
```

## Translation script

A translation script is used to generate the require Elm Strings.Translations module. The translate script currently allows you to specify additional strings in the `strings.en.json` file and default english to the other supported languages so that you or other members of community can provide an appropriate translation for the desired language.

* `yarn watch-i18n` - Use this while you are developing. It will watch your `strings.en.json` file and automatically translate and rebuild `Translations.elm` for you..
